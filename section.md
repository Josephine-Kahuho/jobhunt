### Proposed article title
Creating an Arithmentic Parser for C language using Python

### Proposed article introduction
Parsing happens in the Syntax analysis stage of compiler construction and it works to interpret the meaning of tokens.  

In this article, we cover in depth what a parser is, its role, its goal, types of parsing algorithm and how one can create their own parsers. We will cover creating a parser in Python for arithmetic operations in the C language. 

### Key takeaways
- What is a parser? 
- The role and goals of a parser
- Types of parsing algorithms
- How to create a C language parser in Python for arithmetic expressions

### Article quality
Most articles on the internet cover an creating a parser broadly and do not focus on one topic in a language. This article will focus specifically on creating an arithmetic parser for C language using Python language.
